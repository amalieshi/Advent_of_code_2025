# Advent_of_code_2025
Let the Christmas fun begin! 🎄

This year is a special year for me. I am really enjoying Advent of Code and using it as an opportunity to learn new things and to develop my system thinking skills. Each puzzle is a chance to explore new programming concepts, improve my problem-solving abilities, and have fun with code during the holiday season.

I look forward to sharing my solutions and progress here!

### Day 1 - Rotation
I have implemented a solution for Day 1 of Advent of Code 2025, which involves rotating a set of coordinates based on given instructions. The code is written in Python and utilizes basic data structures and control flow to achieve the desired outcome. I am especially excited that the elves learn about project management to avoid chaos in their work! I personally have also found project management skills to be very useful in my own coding projects. I even had a speech advocating for project management in the Oxford Orator club earlier this year.
You can find my solution in the `day_1/main.py` file. Feel free to check it out and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!

### Day 2 - Finding Repeated Patterns
For Day 2 of Advent of Code 2025, I tackled a problem that involves finding repeated patterns in a sequence of numbers. The challenge was to identify the first number that appears more than once in the sequence. I implemented a solution in Python that efficiently tracks the numbers seen so far and checks for repetitions. This exercise helped me enhance my skills in breaking down the problems and solve them step by step.
