# Advent_of_code_2025
Let the Christmas fun begin! 🎄

This year is a special year for me. I am really enjoying Advent of Code and using it as an opportunity to learn new things and to develop my system thinking skills. Each puzzle is a chance to explore new programming concepts, improve my problem-solving abilities, and have fun with code during the holiday season.

I look forward to sharing my solutions and progress here!

### Day 1 - Rotation
I have implemented a solution for Day 1 of Advent of Code 2025, which involves rotating a set of coordinates based on given instructions. The code is written in Python and utilizes basic data structures and control flow to achieve the desired outcome. I am especially excited that the elves learn about project management to avoid chaos in their work! I personally have also found project management skills to be very useful in my own coding projects. I even had a speech advocating for project management in the Oxford Orator club earlier this year.
You can find my solution in the `day_1/main.py` file. Feel free to check it out and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
